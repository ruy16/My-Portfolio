  "Description": "I grew up in a small city in China called Yichun, meaning spring. I have been studying in the US for almost four years now. During these years, I have learned a lot. I learned how to make a cpu with assembly language;I learned how machines can learn; I learned how to play piano; I learned how to be analytical, but most importantly, I learned about myself and what I want to become, a software engineer. I know I have a passion for this line of work, I just need an opportunity to get started as a professional. I have lots of hobbits, music,cooking, bartending, gaming, basketball,etc. I take my work seriously.Nothing is really fun unless you take it seriously and do it with your heart, this is my motto."
